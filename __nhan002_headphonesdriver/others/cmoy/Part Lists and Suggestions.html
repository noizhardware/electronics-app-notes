<h2>Part Lists and Suggestions</h2>

<p>While reading through these parts lists, you may find it handy to
have a copy of the <a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/cmoy/misc/cmoy-tangent-sch.pdf">schematic</a>
to refer to. (PDF, 4 KB)</p>

<h3 id="req">Required Parts</h3>

<p>These are the parts required to build just the amplifier
circuit. Enclosures, optional components, and enhancement components
are in the next section.</p>

<p>I’ve been happiest with the parts from Digi-Key and
Newark. Mouser sells cheap parts, in both senses of the word, so you
do have to be careful when buying from them.</p>

<p>For those not in the US, I’ve added RS Components, who will
ship almost anywhere in the world. All the parts numbers are simply a
result of me searching through their online catalog. Many times I was
able to find the same parts I recommend from the other distributors,
but occasionally I had to just guess at a replacement, hoping that
it is suitable.</p>

<p>Of the US distributors, Digi-Key is probably the best for
people outside the US to use. Other distributors those outside
the US might investigate are <a href="http://www.farnell.com/">Farnell</a> and
<a href="http://www.conrad.com/">Conrad</a>. Farnell is actually part of the
same company as Newark, but their part numbers aren’t unified,
and they don’t carry all the same parts.</p>

<p>You may not be able to get all of your parts from a single source.
If you are unwilling to order from multiple sources, your best bet is to
choose your distributor based on who has the op-amp(s) you want to use
in your amplifier first, since that is the part in this amp most likely
to push you to one distributor vs another. If you are flexible on your
choice of op-amp, you will be more able to single-source your
amp’s parts from any of the distributors mentioned. (That said,
you may want to read my companion article
<i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/opamps.html">Notes on Audio Op-Amps</a></i> before ordering.) For raw beginners, I
recommend that you stick with the OPA13x series op-amps, because
they’re simply the most forgiving op-amps that also sound
good.</p>

<p>The next part most likely to force a choice of distributor is the
protoboard. See <a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/cmoy/parts.html#board">below</a> for the choices I’m
currently aware of.</p>

<p>For several of the parts in this amp, higher quality components will
give a noticeably superior build, either in terms of sound quality,
durability, or appearance. Examples are the op-amp, the switches, and
the enclosure, respectively.</p>

<p>Other parts, primarily the passive components, are commodities, such
that many manufacturers provide essentially interchangeable parts. That
is not to say that there are not special alternatives, but that you
probably can’t tell one generic blue metal film resistor brand
from another just by listening to it in this amp. If you’re
wondering whether to buy Yageo, BC, or Multicomp resistors, you’re
probably obsessing about something that will have zero noticeable effect
on the amp’s sound quality. Unless you’re choosing to buy
something superior to commodity parts — and for that, see  <a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/cmoy/parts.html#precision">Precision Resistors</a> below — I recommend that
you do not obsess over whether to get your resistors from one source
versus another. Feel free also to substitute other generics with
equivalent specs, if that is convenient for you.</p>

<p>By that, I do not mean to endorse replacing generic components
recommended below with <i>nonequivalents</i>. I have seen people build
this amp with 5% carbon resistors instead of the 1% metal film resistors
I recommend, for example. For just one reason why you should not do
that, please read my companion article,
<i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/resmatch.html">Hand-Matching Resistors to Tighter Tolerances</a></i>.</p>

<p>There is one component that I would not discourage compromises on,
and that is the protoboard, because the primary benefit of the expensive
stuff is that it will stand up to repeated soldering and desoldering.
Since you’ll be building the amp once and probably then leaving it
alone, you might as well use cheap protoboard. There are other benefits
to FR4 over phenolic paper board, but they are not likely to affect the
behavior of this sort of circuit.</p>

<p>Some components are marked “Alt.” These are alternatives
for the immediately preceding component.</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><b>*</b> These caps are much bigger than the
ones in the photos on subsequent pages, and so aren’t great
choices for amps in mint tins and other compact enclosures. In exchange
for the bulk, you get better sound. The farther down the list of
alternatives you go, the worse the sound gets, with the last ones still
being okay, but recommended only when space is at a premium. The
barrel-shaped axial lead caps in the pictures are the Vishay MKT1813s on
the second row, from Mouser.</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><b>**</b> If you must use stripboard (such as
because you can’t get the recommended perfboard style), you will
need to have some way to break the copper strips at strategic points. RS
Components sells a stripboard cutter (543-535) for this purpose.
Alternately, you could simply use an X-acto knife, which will not
produce breaks as definitive as the stripboard cutter, but should
suffice.</p>


<h3 id="opt">Optional Parts</h3>

<p>Here are some parts that you may need, or that are
“preference” things: I can’t call them required,
since some may disagree.</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><b>*</b> Although you only need an SPST for
power, SPDTs are more common, probably because it’s just as easy
to make them as SPSTs and you can use them like an SPST by just leaving
the second pole disconnected. Since they’re more widely useful
than SPSTs, some manufacturers only make SPDT toggles. (Or at least,
distributors don’t often carry the SPST variants if the
manufacturer does make them.)</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><b>**</b> These “micro” switches are
the smallest type of toggles you can easily find. Micro toggles tend to
be rather delicate, especially the bushing area. I’ve broken these
simply by tightening the mounting nut to a tension that is normal for
mini toggle switches.  If you can afford the space, I recommend that you
use standard mini toggles instead. They’re much tougher, and they
often look better, too.</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><b>***</b> These pots have a built-in SPST
switch, which save you the cost and panel space of a separate power
switch. It really saves time on the build, and I think it makes the amp
look neater. Naturally, it means you have to readjust the volume every
time you turn the amp on. You can get this same pot without the switch.
I believe the RS Components part number for that is 249-9159. The
equivalent from Mouser is *probably* the 688-RK097122008T, but I
haven’t looked too closely into it.</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><b>****</b> Beware, this pot’s body is
too big to fit into a mint tin. (Actually, it can be done, but you have
to notch the lid to get it to close around the mounting nut.)</p>


<h3 id="precision">Precision Resistors</h3>

<p>All resistors spec’d above are generic 1% metal film
resistors.  Generic resistors work fine, but many people swear by
premium resistors because of their higher inherent accuracy and higher
thermal stability. (The latter means that as the resistor heats up due
to the power it’s dissipating, it changes value less than generic
resistors. All resistors change value as they change temperture;
premium resistors simply change value to a lesser degree.)</p>

<p>The most popular brand for this is Vishay-Dale’s CMF
(a.k.a. RN) series. Specifically, the RN55x-F (1%) type. (For
full details on how to interpret these CMF values, see the
<a href="http://www.vishay.com/docs/31027/cmfmil.pdf">CMF data
sheet</a>.) Vishay-Dale CMF resistors are more expensive than generics,
but in the quantities needed for this amp, the additional cost is
negligible.</p>

<p>The Vishay CMF line also has 0.1% resistors, but you do not
need that level of precision for this amp. If you do anything
to get more accuracy, it should be to use a good multimeter
to <a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/resmatch.html">hand-match your resistors to higher
tolerances</a>.  That may provide some audible improvement to some
ears, but realize that this is <i>relative</i> matching. The point of
buying 0.1% resistors is that their <i>absolute</i> values are within
0.1% of nominal. There are very few places in audio where absolute
value accuracy is important.</p>

<p>If you can’t get Vishays but still want to try premium
resistors, RS Components offers the RC series from Welwyn. I’ve
never heard a report about whether these are an improvement
over generics, but the specs suggest they’re on par with
Vishay-Dale’s CMF series. They’re physically a bit bigger
since RS only offers the <span class="nobreak">1/4 W</span> resistors, but the price is
similar to <span class="nobreak">1/8 W</span> 1% Vishays.</p>

<p>Herewith, part numbers for Vishay-Dale RN55C/D resistors in all
the values given above:</p>

<h3 id="eighth">Are <span class="nobreak">1/8 W</span> Resistors Sufficient?</h3>

<p>I spec <span class="nobreak">1/4 W</span> resistors for the generics above simply because
they’re the most readily available sort, not because the CMoy amp
really dissipates <span class="nobreak">1/4 W</span> anywhere in the circuit. The resistors
in a CMoy amp that see the highest load are the power supply splitter
resistors. With the highest supply voltage you’re likely to
use — <span class="nobreak">30 V</span> — these resistors only dissipate about
<span class="nobreak">50 mW</span>. Therefore, even <span class="nobreak">1/8 W</span> resistors are adequate for
all aspects of the CMoy design.</p>


<h3 id="board">Circuit Board Alternatives</h3>

<p>This tutorial was written around the RadioShack 276-0150 patterned
perfboard. Now that RadioShack is out of the retail electronics
business, that product is no longer available. However, there are many
places to get compatible patterned protoyping boards via mail order.</p>

<p>In the US, RadioShack still offers this product <a href="https://www.radioshack.com/apps/search-results#stq=2760150">through
their web site</a>. (If that link breaks, search for
“2760150”, without dashes.)</p>

<p>Another option in the US is Newark part #38C9100. It is basically
identical to the 276-0150 board from RadioShack.</p>

<p>For those outside the US, the most readily available alternative is
RS Components part number 631-3223. A spot check of several of their
country-specific sites doesn’t turn it up, but it is on their <a href="http://int.rsdelivers.com/">international</a> and UK sites.</p>

<p>That same board (the Sunhayato ICB-86) is also available from other
sources, mainly on Asian electronics parts supply sites. You might also
be able to find an alternate version of the board, part number ICB-86G,
which uses a higher-quality epoxy-fiberglass board, rather than the
cheaper phenolic paper substrate. RS Components sells it as part number
631-3239. The only reason to get this version is if you plan on doing a
lot of rework to the board, as it is more likely to withstand repeated
soldering.</p>

<p>If none of those options work for you, there are a number of
patterned perfboard designs on the market that are close enough that
adapting the <a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/cmoy/misc/mini-cmoy-layout-0150.pdf">layout presented
here</a> is straightforward.</p>

<p>Many items in the <a href="http://busboard.com/breadboards">SB
series</a> from <a href="http://busboard.com/">BusBoard Prototype
Systems</a> are suitable, including the SB300, SB400, and SB404. Their
<a href="http://www.busboard.com/POW3U">POW3U</a> board is a similar
design, though much larger than necessary here, so you’d have to
cut it down if you can’t find one of the SB series. You can find
BusBoard products many places online, <a href="http://amzn.to/1Pm09JX">including Amazon.com</a>. I haven’t
studied these board layouts in detail, but it looks like you might even
be able to get away without adding the M jumpers needed to make the
RadioShack board work, because the 5-hole pads surrounding the central
bus strips should provide sufficient tie points for this circuit.</p>

<p>In much the same vein as the BusBoard POW3U is the Roth Elektronik
RE315-LF, available from the <a href="http://www.farnell.com/">Farnell</a>/<a href="http://www.newark.com/">Newark</a> behemoth. Farnell lists it as
part number 1172142 from Farnell, while Newark calls it part number
26M2205. This is a much bigger board than the RadioShack board, but if
you study its layout, you can see that there are several ways to cut
this board up to create something similar to the half-2760150 board used
in the in the tutorial’s standard board layout. As with the
BusBoard offerings, it looks like fewer jumpers would be needed to use
this board than with the RadioShack board. It uses 4-hole pads around
the central bus strips rather than the 5-hole pads used by the BusBoard
products, so it might require a few jumpers where the BusBoard offerings
do not.</p>

<p>If you must use a much different type of protoboard, I recommend
<i>against</i> trying to use the same parts layout I came up with for
the RadioShack board. Instead, create a new layout tuned to that
pattern. If your board has a very generic pattern, such as stripboard or
pad-per-hole board, I’d probably just go with a point-to-point
layout: all the connections are made direct from one part lead to
another on the bottom side of the board, instead of going through copper
foils on the board itself.</p>

<h3 id="op-amp">Choosing an Op-Amp</h3>

<p>The op-amp (operational amplifier) is the chip that does the actual
amplification in the CMoy circuit. It has the single biggest effect
on sound and power draw of any component, so it behooves you to pick
this part carefully. It’s also the part most likely to fail if
your implementation is imperfect; a tolerant op-amp will reduce the
chances of failure.</p>

<p>If you’re a raw newbie, I recommend that you try one
of the Burr-Brown OPA132/134 series op-amps first because they
have low voltage requirements, they don’t oscillate easily
(see below), the lowest grade is adequate for this project and is
quite reasonably priced, and they’re very popular so a lot of
your fellow DIYers are familiar with them and so can help you more
easily. I won’t say they’re easy to find; you’ll
probably have to mail-order one. Take my word: these are very good
chips for the price. Any replacement you try and source locally will
likely not perform as well.</p>

<p class="aside">“Oscillation” is a condition where the
chip develops periodic or constant noise due to problems in the
surrounding circuit. If you keep at this hobby, you will eventually
develop the necessary knowledge and experience to avoid oscillation
in your circuits. Until then, stick with tolerant op-amps.</p>

<p>The specific chip I recommend for beginners is the OPA2132PA. Under
ideal conditions, the cheaper OPA2134PA performs just as well, but your
first DIY headphone amp probably won’t be flawless. I’ve
had circuits where the OPA2134PA would distort or oscillate, but
popping in a 2132PA or 2132P would fix the problem. As a beginner,
you don’t need problems like this. You’ll have enough
difficulties just assembling and testing the thing without the op-amp
acting up as well! If you later want to build another amp, go ahead
and try the 2134PA. If you run into problems, you can pull the 2132
out of your first amp temporarily and try that in the new amp to see
if it fixes the problem.</p>

<p>As for the OPA2132P, it’s about twice the price of the 2132PA,
and I can’t hear a difference relative to the 2132PA. This
isn’t surprising, since the only specs that are different between
the two chips are the DC specs, and there is no DC in audio.</p>

<p>If you think you might want to try different op-amps in your
headphone amp, it’s all but mandatory that you use DIP sockets in
your design so you don’t have to desolder the chip to try a new
one. Sockets are useful even if you never change the chip since they
prevent damage to the sensitive op-amp chip during soldering. However,
you should only use high-quality machined sockets. If you can only
find cheap sockets, you’re better off just soldering the op-amp
to the board, because a cheap socket will result in weak connections,
which is a serious risk factor for bad sound.</p>

<p>If for some reason you want to try another op-amp, first give my
companion article “<i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/opamps.html">Notes on Audio Op-Amps</a></i>” a read.
There’s a fair chance I’ve already reviewed the chip
you’re looking at. My test circuit is a lightly-modified CMoy
pocket amplifier, so if I give a chip you want to use a bad review, it
maens it doesn’t work well in a CMoy. If I haven’t reviewed
the chip or my review is sketchy, it may be because it is not a good fit
for a CMoy. Generally speaking, you want to use chips similar to the
OPA134/132 family: JFET-input, middlin’ bandwidth, capable of
driving low impedances from low supply voltages. That knocks out a huge
number of op-amps on the market right there.</p>


<h3 id="enclosures">Choosing an Enclosure</h3>

<p>There are two main kinds of enclosures used for pocket amps:
plastic enclosures designed to house electronics, and various types
of boxes designed for other uses and converted to hold an amp. The
latter includes the popular mint tins, plus other found objects.</p>

<p>For general portable use, I like the <a href="http://serpac.com/h-series.aspx">Serpac H series cases</a>. The <a href="http://serpac.com/h659V.aspx">H659V</a> (1.0 × 2.75 ×
4.95 in.) has plenty of space inside for a CMoy circuit, its rounded
corners and slim body give it a sleek look, and this particular variant
includes a nice <span class="nobreak">9 V</span> battery compartment with fixed contacts
instead of the more common floppy <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:9_volt_Battery_Snap.jpg">battery
snap</a>. The overall impression is of a pocket cigarillo case; it slips
into a pocket very nicely. There is a taller version called the H-67.
While the <span class="nobreak">9 V</span> version of the H-67 only holds one battery, the
“AC” version has a battery door without a battery
compartment behind it; you can stuff two <span class="nobreak">9 V</span> batteries in there.
You’ll have to add some padding and such to keep the batteries
from rattling around inside the case if you go this route.</p>

<p>If you’re thinking of going with a much larger case but
still want to be able to run from batteries, I recommend adding
a Bulgin dual-<span class="nobreak">9 V</span> battery drawer to one of the larger cases
(Mouser part #122-BX0026).</p>


<h3 id="power">Power Supply Choices</h3>

<p>Your choices in this area go much deeper than “one <span class="nobreak">9 V</span>
battery or two,” and “batteries or wall power?” so the
topic is covered elsewhere:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/cmoy/tweaks.html#dcjack">Adding a DC Power Jack</a></li>

  <li><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/opamps.html">Notes on Audio Op-Amps</a></li>

  <li><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/elec/vgrounds.html">Virtual Ground Circuits</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a deep topic, so each of those link’s targets then
links out to further information.</p>

<p>If you just want an easy answer, put 2 × <span class="nobreak">9 V</span> batteries in
series and call it good. That’s not the best method on several
axes, but it is the overall easiest for this circuit design.</p>


<h3 id="jacks">Audio and DC Jacks</h3>

<p>There are differences among the recommended audio jacks above that
make some of them unsuitable for some configurations. The biggest thing
to look out for is that if you’re going to use a metal enclosure
and are going to also use a wall power supply that either the audio
jacks or the DC inlet jack needs to be insulated, else you’ll end
up tying V- to virtual ground through the case, causing the amp to fail
when plugged in.</p>
